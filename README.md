### 1A2B
> This project is for practicing Java programming.

1A2B is a famous game. Here is the process of this game:
1. There are four distinct secret numbers. Each digit is range from 0 to 9.
2. The player guess the numbers.
3. If the a number in the guess is in the secret numbers, there are two situations:
    1. The number is in the same position as it is in the secret numbers, then the player gets a A.
    2. The number is in the different position, then the player gets a B.
4. The game ends until the player guess the correct numbers in the same order in the secret numbers.

### Versions
V1: I code this game in Java. Most of the statements are in the main function.
V2: I practice to use classes to code this game. One abstract class and two subclasses.
